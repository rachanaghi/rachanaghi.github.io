			<p> Only two days to go until I board the plane for San Francisco to begin my journey. I can’t believe it’s so soon! Though I’ve known that I’m going abroad for a while, I’ve been so caught up in the logistics of visas, medicals and shots, and preparing to pack – but now it’s starting to really hit home! – And I feel so unprepared :S How does one prepare for a trip like this? I packed most of my stuff yesterday, and I think packing cubes definitely helped me out a ton in terms of staying organized. However, even though the bag is only around 30 pounds, I have such a hard time carrying it  Guess I need to start working out. Still need to pack a few extra things, and then I should be set! Considering repacking though since it’s been heavily emphasized to pack lightly since we’re always moving around within the countries as well. </p>

			<p>I just called my bank to let them know I’m going abroad, so they don’t freeze my card when I use it overseas. I’m preparing to do some assignments now for the classes we have next week. Ha. Somehow it left my mind that I’m still going to be taking classes since I’ve been so bogged down trying to prepare. However, I watched a movie (Chinatown 1974), and that was pretty interesting, so I imagine the readings will be as well. I’ve been on extended vacation though, and I’ve been pretty lazy to be honest, so I’m going to have a hard time starting to work again. Bye bye to watching friends all the time  (On season 8 episode 10 – and I began it during the break, so there’s binge watching it for you haha).</p>

			I don’t know what this journey holds, but I feel like it’ll be life changing – and my heart can tell it too, as it keeps thumping rapidly thinking about going to all these different places. I’m nervous, excited, anxious, and basically all sorts of emotions bundled into one. I told myself that I’m going into this study abroad with a blank state: No expectations that it’s always going to a great time, but no expectations that it’ll be horrible. It will just be what it is. :) </p>

			<p> I’m still in shock that over the course of the next four months, I will be travelling to Vietnam, Morocco, and Bolivia. I knew that I wanted to study abroad at some point during my college years, but I never imagined that I’d be going to three completely different countries – and two continents that I have never been to before. I was ecstatic when I got into the program – especially since the program specifically focuses on my two majors: environmental studies and economics. I’ll be studying the social impacts of climate change through the political economy of food, water, and energy. While I’ve taken global climate change at Washington and Lee, I think it’s going to be a whole new experience learning about it outside the classroom and around the world.</p>
			<p>The last few months have just been me trying to get all three of my visas since I have a Nepali passport. There were many hiccups during this process, but I was happy when I had all three of my visas stamped in my passport. However, I still needed to research transit visas, etc. One main thing I’ve learned from this whole process: it sucks to have a Nepali passport when trying to travel the world, and it takes a wholee lot of preparation.
