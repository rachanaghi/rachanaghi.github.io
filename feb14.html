				   <p class="sub"> My two weeks in San Francisco have come to an end! These past weeks have felt exceptionally long and short at the same time. I’ve been pretty exhausted, and I haven’t had much time to write down things. I have classes from 9 am to anywhere from 5 to 7 pm, and usually after dinner, I’m so tired that I just end up falling asleep. But I’ve met so many cool people! Everyone on the trip seems very open-minded, and just overall wonderful human beings, so I’m excited to be sharing my journey with them. I have been really amazed at the level of sophistication and passion that they have.  I’ve also gone around San Francisco a bit (look at all the pictures! Sorry I’ve been so bad at putting them up)
					   I have learned way more than I ever imagined in just the first two weeks that I cannot put it all down. I feel exceptionally grateful that I decided to do this program though I was pretty nervous about it. From guest lectures, to site visits, to just conversations with the people around me – it’s really been experimental learning (though there are a lot of readings that I procrastinate to do).
					   Some things that I want to reflect on during my time here:
					   <ol>
						<li>  <p class="sub"> What does it mean to be “American”? </p> 
						   
						   <p class="sub"> This is a topic that has crossed my mind multiple times during this trip. Being born in Nepal and having strong ties to my Nepalese roots, I never completely felt at ease just calling myself American. I grew up pretty much my whole life in America, yet I’m not a citizen, and I still hold my Nepalese passport. However, when I was in Nepal during the sophomore year of high school, I realized that I didn’t completely fit in there either. This feeling of not belonging to one place has caused a lot of confusion in my life – especially given the fact that I’ve moved around so often. During my first interactions with people here, the most common question was: “Where are you from?” A quite simple question on the surface, but it was actually quite a hard question to answer. How do I explain where I’m from when a part of my heart is everywhere I’ve lived?  The word “hiraeth” comes to mind when thinking about this, it roughly translates to: A homesickness for a home which you cannot return, a home which maybe never was; the nostalgia, the yearning, the grief for the lost places of your past. When I say I feel “homesick”, I could be missing my family in Massachusetts, or my brother in Texas, or my friends in Louisiana, or the playground in Oklahoma where I grew up, or my native roots in Nepal. Needless to say, I’m learning a lot about myself and thinking about things more deeply during the program. </p>
						   
						   </li>
					
						<li> <p class = "sub">Step-In Reflections </p> 
						   
							<p class= "sub">
					   We did an activity during community building session that really stood out to me as I’ve seen it done on youtube, but I’ve never experienced it myself. The travelling fellow would read out a statement, and people would either step in or step out of the circle. It was a very emotional time as the statements were pretty personal ones. I was surprised by how brave everyone was, and how willing to be open about themselves. I learned a lot about the values that are important to me, and how I view myself during this session as well.</p>
						   
						   </li>
					 
						   
						   <li> <p class = "sub">Homelessness in San Francisco</p> 
						   
							<p class= "sub">
								I’ve seen that homelessness has been very prominent in San Francisco, which is strange to me, as I haven’t ever seen such a high amount of it before. When walking the streets to class or to the BART or to grab lunch (just anywhere really), I see more than five homeless people on every street corner. It was shocking. My mind doesn’t know what to think about it, and my heart feels heavy every time I see people without food and shelter. People usually imagine poverty as being something that is international, but it is very much a real thing in the USA as well. It is a thing that I’ve been grappling to understand.</p>
						   </li>
					 
					   <li> <p class = "sub">On being a woman</p> 
						   
							<p class= "sub">
								On the same note, I’ve been more conscious about the fact that I’m a woman during this trip. When walking down the streets, there are times when my friends and I are cat-called. The feeling is a demeaning one, but one that we should be prepared for as we travel around. This is one of the things that I am most anxious about: Being in an unfamiliar environment and having a stranger hit on you for the simple fact that you are a woman. I have been sheltered most of my life, and I haven’t had to dealt with being harassed except the few times in Louisiana, and now the times here. I’m trying to remember to stay positive, but also to be consciously aware and safe.</p>
